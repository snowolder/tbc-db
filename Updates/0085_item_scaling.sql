-- bit of a backstory - there is a 50% chance this is a tbc blizzlike bug
-- these are dmg hit items which do a fixed amount on hits and they used to scale through spell power
-- through some part of TBC
-- removing this for other expansions (vanilla,wotlk) and for tbc so we do not have a broken rogue spell damage build
